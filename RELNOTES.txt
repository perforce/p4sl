	Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com

Requirements

	* Matlab 2017b or higher.	

	* Perforce server at Release 2017.1 or higher.

	* Java: full standard JDK 8 or later.  Implementation as
	  discussed in "Known Limitations" below.

	* SSL: unlimited strength JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) package for
	  256-bit encryption level SSL connection to a secure Perforce server.

SSL and Trust

	Perforce server 2017.1 or higher supports 256-bit SSL connections
	and trust establishment via accepting the fingerprint of the SSL
	certificate's public key. The standard JDK comes with 128-bit
	encryption level ciphers. In order to use P4Java to connect to
	a secure Perforce server, you must download and install the
	unlimited strength JCE package for your JDK version.

Documentation

	Please visit www.perforce.com for P4SL Plugin guide.

Installation

	Download either matlab toolbox file (p4sl.mltbx) or p4sl.jar file
	from the Perforce website. For simple instructions on how to install and use,
	please refer to the README.MD or plugin guide.

Known Limitations

	* For Java versions prior to JDK 7, P4SL does not correctly
	  implement or deal with Unix / Linux and Windows symbolic links.
	  This is a known issue related to older (prior to JDK 7) versions
	  of Java's inability to itself implement symbolic links.

	* The Perforce server (2015.1 or higher) only supports 256-bit
	  encryption.  Due to current US export control restrictions
	  for some countries, the standard JDK package only comes with
	  128-bit encryption level ciphers.  In order to use P4SL to
	  connect to a secure Perforce server, those living in eligible
	  countries may download the unlimited strength JCE (Java
	  Cryptography Extension) version and replace the current
	  default cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength
	  files. These files are located at:

	  <java-home>/lib/security/local_policy.jar
	  <java-home>/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar
